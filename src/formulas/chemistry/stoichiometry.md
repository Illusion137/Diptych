# Stoichiometry Formulas

## Moles from Mass

### Formula
$ n = \frac{m}{M} $

### Variables
- $ n $: Number of moles (mol)
- $ m $: Mass of substance (grams)
- $ M $: Molar mass of substance (g/mol)

### Usage
Used to convert the mass of a substance to the number of moles.

## Moles from Number of Particles

### Formula
$ n = \frac{N}{N_A} $

### Variables
- $ n $: Number of moles (mol)
- $ N $: Number of particles (atoms, molecules, ions)
- $ N_A $: Avogadro's number ($6.022 	imes 10^{23} 	ext{ particles/mol}$)

### Usage
Used to convert the number of particles of a substance to the number of moles.

## Molarity

### Formula
$ C = \frac{n}{V} $

### Variables
- $ C $: Molarity (mol/L)
- $ n $: Number of moles of solute (mol)
- $ V $: Volume of solution (liters)

### Usage
Used to express the concentration of a solution.

## Percent Yield

### Formula
$ 	ext{Percent Yield} = \frac{	ext{Actual Yield}}{	ext{Theoretical Yield}} 	imes 100\% $

### Variables
- $ 	ext{Actual Yield} $: The amount of product actually obtained from a reaction.
- $ 	ext{Theoretical Yield} $: The maximum amount of product that can be formed from the given amounts of reactants.

### Usage
Used to assess the efficiency of a chemical reaction.
